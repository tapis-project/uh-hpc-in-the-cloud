    "\n",
    "The Tapis API provides a way to access and manage the data storage and compute resources you already use (or maybe the systems you want to use), but first you have to tell Tapis where they are, how to login, and how to communicate with that system.  That is done by giving Tapis a short JSON description for each system.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Tapis Storage Systems\n",
    "\n",
    "Storage systems tell Tapis where data resides.  You can store files for running compute jobs, archive results, share files with collaborators, and maintain copies of your Tapis apps on storage systems.  Tapis supports many of the communication protocols and  permissions models that go along with them, so you can work privately, collaborate with individuals, or provide an open community resource.  It's up to you.  Here is an example of a simple data storage system template accessed via SFTP for the TACC Corral cloud storage system:\n",
    "```json\n",
    "{\n",
    "  \"id\": \"UPDATEUSERNAME.tacc.corral.storage\",\n",
    "  \"name\": \"Storage system for TACC cloud storage on corral\",\n",
    "  \"status\": \"UP\",\n",
    "  \"type\": \"STORAGE\",\n",
    "  \"description\": \"Storage system for TACC cloud storage on corral\",\n",
    "  \"site\": \"www.tacc.utexas.edu\",\n",
    "  \"public\": false,\n",
    "  \"default\": true,\n",
    "  \"storage\": {\n",
    "    \"host\": \"cloud.corral.tacc.utexas.edu\",\n",
    "    \"port\": 22,\n",
    "    \"protocol\": \"SFTP\",\n",
    "    \"rootDir\": \"/\",\n",
    "    \"homeDir\": \"/home/UPDATEUSERNAME/\",\n",
    "    \"auth\": {\n",
    "      \"username\": \"UPDATEUSERNAME\",\n",
    "      \"password\": \"UPDATEPASSWORD\",\n",
    "      \"type\": \"PASSWORD\"\n",
    "    }\n",
    "  }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hands-on\n",
    "\n",
    "As a hands on exercise, using the Tapis CLI, register you a data storage system using PASSWORD authentication with the above template for the TACC Corral Cloud store. Don't forget to replace *UPDATEUSERNAME* and *UPDATE PASSWORD*.  Call the JSON file \"corral_cloud.json\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Then the CLI command to use is:\n",
    "```\n",
    "systems-addupdate -F cloud_corral.json\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The above command will submit the JSON file \"cloud_corral.json\" to Tapis and create a new system with the attributes specified in the JSON file.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can now see the you new system by running the following Tapis CLI command:\n",
    "```\n",
    "systems-list\n",
    "```\n",

    "### Tapis Execution Systems\n",
    "\n",
    "Execution systems in Tapis are very similar to storage systems.  They just have additional information for how to launch jobs.  In this example, we are using the Stampede2 HPC system, so we have to give scheduler and queue information.  This system description is longer than the storage definition due to logins, queues, scratch systems definitions.\n",

    "We covered what some of these keywords are in the storage systems section.  Below is some commentary on the new fields:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **executionType** - Either HPC, Condor, or CLI.  Specifies how jobs should go into the system. HPC and Condor will leverage a batch scheduler. CLI will fork processes.\n",
    "* **scheduler** - For HPC or CONDOR systems, Agave is \"scheduler aware\" and can use most popular schedulers to launch jobs on the system.  This field can be LSF, LOADLEVELER, PBS, SGE, CONDOR, FORK, COBALT, TORQUE, MOAB, SLURM, UNKNOWN. The type of batch scheduler available on the system.\n",
    "* **environment** - List of key-value pairs that will be added to the Linux shell environment prior to execution of any command.\n",
    "* **scratchDir** - Whenever Agave runs a job, it uses a temporary directory to cache any app assets or job data it needs to run the job.  This job directory will exist under the \"scratchDir\" that you set.  The path in this field will be resolved relative to the rootDir value in the storage config if it begins with a \"/\", and relative to the system homeDir otherwise.\n",

    "As a hands on exercise, register the Stampede2 HPC as a execution system using the Tapis-CLI using the above JSON template. - Don't forget to change *UPDATEUSERNAME* and *UPDATEPASSWORD* to your tutorial or TACC username and *UPDATEPROJECT* and *UPDATERESERVATION* for this workshops Stampede2 provided project and reservation (or your personal ones if doing this on your own).  \n",
    "\n",
    "In your CLI you can now get a list of your systems using:\n",
    "```\n",
    "systems-list\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to view just the storage systems you can use -S. For execution systems use -E.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also set a default storage system that Tapis can default to:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "systems-setdefault USERNAME.tacc.corral.storage\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Default systems are the systems that are used when the user does not specify a system to use when performing a remote action in Tapis. For example, specifying an archivePath in a job request, but no archiveSystem, or specifying a deploymentPath in an app description, but no deploymentSystem. In these situations, Tapis will use the userâ€™s default storage system."
