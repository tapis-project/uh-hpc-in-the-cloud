    "As of Singularity v2.4 by default `build` produces immutable images in the 'squashfs' file format. This ensures reproducible and verifiable images.\n",
    "\n",
    "Creating a `--writable` image must use the `sudo` command, thus the owner of the container is `root`\n",
    "\n",

    "### 4.6 Bind Paths\n",
    "\n",
    "When Singularity creates the new file system inside a container it ignores directories that are not part of the standard kernel, e.g. `/scratch`, `/xdisk`, `/global`, etc. These paths can be added back into the container by binding them when the container is run.\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The system administrator can also define what is added to a container. This is important on campus HPC systems that often have a `/scratch` or `/xdisk` directory structure. By editing the `/etc/singularity/singularity.conf` a new path can be added to the system containers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.7 Overlay\n",
    "\n",
    "You can make changes to an immutable container which only persist for the duration of the container being run.\n",
