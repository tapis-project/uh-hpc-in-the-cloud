    "Tutorial: Getting Started with Tapis CLI\n",
    "===============================================\n",
    "The following instructions will guide you through setting up Tapis CLI.  As an aside, everything we do today can also be accomplished from a command line interface or by directly calling API endpoints.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The Tapis CLI commands all respond with help for -h and return back information on the parameters that can be passed.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Need help?  Ask your questions using the TACC Cloud Slack Channel TODO_SLACKLINK\n",
    "\n",
    "Initial Requirements\n",
    "===============================================\n",
    "\n",
    "Before getting started, you need to have the following:\n",
    "* A TACC Account - today you have a test account\n",
    "* SSH access to the Stampede 2 compute cluster and an allocation.\n",
    "* Familiarity with [editing text files](https://www.nano-editor.org/dist/v2.7/nano.html) and [working at the command line](http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bashref.html#Introduction)\n",
    "\n",
    "Any questions?  Join the TACC CLOUD SLACK and ask away.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Command Line Access\n",
    "===================\n",
    "\n",
    "We won't install it in this workshop (since it is already installed on the VM), but everything we do today can also be done from the standard shell using the Tapis CLI tools.  Instructions for installing those tools are below:\n",
    "\n",
    "Installing the Tapis CLI Tools\n",
    "------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "Tapis has a downloadable set of command line tools that make it easier to work with the API from the shell. Using these scripts is generally easier than hand-crafting cURL commands, but if you prefer that route, consult the [Tapis API Documentation](https://tacc-cloud.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). We include these scripts in the training virtual machines and supplement them with additional support scripts, example files, and documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "During the course, we will use the Jetstream Cloud virtual machines, but if you have a shell on your personal computer, you can install these tools on your own personal later.\n",
    "\n",
    "To use access the CLI for this tutorial you can open a Terminal  in Jupyter which give you access to the shell in the Jetstream VM, OR *ssh* into the system from you own terminal:\n",
    "\n",
    "```ssh ubunut@jetstreamvm_ip_address```\n",
    "\n",
    "Install the CLI tools\n",
    "----------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "The CLI tools and instructions for installation can be found in the [CLI repository](https://github.com/TACC-Cloud/agave-cli)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Install the CLI tools with Docker\n",
    "----------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "docker build -t tapis-cli:latest\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Let create the directory the Tapis CLI needs to save and track it's state in:\n",
    "```\n",
    "mkdir ~/.agave\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we can run CLI command with the docker container and mount the our home directory volume so our local files are available in the container:\n",
    "```\n",
    "docker run -v /home/username/.agave:/root/.agave tapis-cli:latest\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "NOTE that we use -v to mount a volume that contians /home/username/.agave so that the container can write directly to that folder and anything written there will be available on the host and therefore can exist after we stop or remove the Docker container - this is useful for using different versions of the CLI container as updates and patches are released.\n",
    "\n",
    "The CLI tools are installed in /agave-cli/bin within the Docker conatiner so if you move to that directory you can see all the commands available:\n",
    "```\n",
    "cd /agave/cli\n",
    "ls\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Updating the CLI with Docker\n",
    "----------------\n",
    "\n",
    "In the future, you can update the Tapis CLI automatically to the latest version by pulling down the docker container with the tag \"latest\" and running you\n",
    "\n",
    "```docker pull tapis-cli:latest```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Authentication\n",
    "----------------\n",
    "\n",
    "Tapis has robust Authentication/Authorization pathways - we could easliy spend an hour or more discussing them, but will keep our focus simple for this tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Tapis API uses OAuth 2 for managing authentication and authorization. \n",
    "\n",
    "Run the following in you CLI docker container\n",
    "```\n",
    ">auth-check\n",
    "Please run /agave-cli/bin/tenants-init to initialize your client before attempting to interact with the APIs.\n",
    "```\n",
    "We will see that we have to initialize some things before we can use Tapis.\n",
    "Initialize the CLI\n",
    "------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "The first time you install the CLI tools on a computer, you need to initialize it.\n",
    "You can initialize the TACC tenant by runnning:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    ">mkdir ~/.agave\n",
    ">docker run -v /home/username/.agave:/root/.agave tapis-cli:latest\n",

This is the file that the CLI tools will look for when making API calls so that you don't have to enter those parameters for every call.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Creating a Client \n",
    "----------------\n",
    "The Tapis API uses OAuth 2 for managing authentication and authorization. Before you work with Tapis, you must create an OAuth client application and record the API keys that are returned. This is a one-time action per machine that you use the CLI and the 'auth-session-init' can take care of this.  In the event you need to create your own client you can pass additional parameters to the 'auth-session-init' command.  For instance if we want to make a new client.\n",

So, please take a moment and record *client_name*, *consumerKey*, and *consumerSecret* somewhere safe. If you lose these values, you can create a new instance of the client by deleting the old client (clients-delete CLIENT_NAME) and creating it again (or create a new client with a different name).\n",
    "\n",
    " OAuth 2 API authentication token\n",
    "----------------\n",
    "\n",
    "Tokens are a form of short-lived, temporary authenticiation and authorization used in place of your username and password. To interact with Tapis, you will need to acquire one. Each Tapis token, typically, expires after 4 hours, but can easily be refreshed.\n",
    "\n",
    "On a host where you have configured a Tapis OAuth2 client already, the CLI command to get a new token is:\n",

    "API password:\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You will then be prompted to enter your *API password*. **Type your user password**.  At this point, you should receive an affirmation of success in your terminal that resembles this one:\n",

    "\n",
    "## Refreshing your token\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial won't take very long, but if you are interrupted and come back later, you might find your token has expired. You can always refresh a token as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```root@291b0fe43291:/# auth-tokens-refresh -v```\n",
